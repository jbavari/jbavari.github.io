After doing a [2019 in review](/posts/2019-in-review.html), I wanted to set up some new routines for some extra discipline in my life for 2020.

Some systems that I want to set up:

* Reading more.
* Writing more.
* Practicing mindfulness to achieve happiness.
* Practicing [clear and present](https://blog.davidtate.org/clear-and-present-leadership/) leadership everyday I can (which is everyday).
* Spending time with friends and loved ones.
* Traveling more.
* Working on projects that help me grow my technical acumen and skillset.
* Giving back to my community (technical, city, or other ways).
* Speaking up in the community, at start up events, or technical events.
* Maintaining a healthy life - through daily walks, working out, and getting back to training jiu jitsu 3 times a week.

Now, those are my systems. Based on those systems, I'd like to achieve some goals:

* Have listened (audible) to 40 books this year.
* Have read (physical or kindle) 40 books this year.
* Have finished writing a book draft for my first book.
* Writing at least 2 blog posts a month.
* Have been present and aware as much as I could physically and mentally.
* Practicing leadership with people I mentor or in the community.
* Camped 10 different sites with friends and family.
* Traveled to two countries this year.
* Completed a meaningful project that helps people sell their used goods.
* Given a talk at Ignite Boulder.
* Have spoke at one technical conference.
* Get back to a healthy 185lbs and be healhy enough to train jiu-jitsu 3 times a week consistently.

I realize many of these goals seem binary, and thus, hard to measure. I will measure them by marking a calendar with the days that I achieve the above conditions. By the end of the year, I should see a high percentage of successes in the goals.

# Stop, Start, Continue

I just read [the QBQ 3-step upgrade post](https://qbq.com/3-step-upgrade-how-to-become-a-better-me/) about how to 'be a better me'. I wanted to try out that exercise here.

## I will stop doing

* Complaining about things unless I'm willing to act on it.
* Playing the victim card. I am taking full accountability.
* Accusing other people for things that make me unhappy, I will make that my internal focus.
* Doing things that do not bring me joy.
* Masking my anger by using sarcasm.

## I will start doing

* Measuring what matters to me - my reading, my exercise, my habits.
* Taking accountability for my actions.
* Doing more self-care activities, like physical therapy, exercise, etc.
* Doing more, talking less.
* Living more by a budget.
* Practicing randicle candor.
* Reaching out to my parents on a daily/weekly cadence.

## I will continue doing

* Being kind whenever possible, it's always possible
* Helping others when I can (the idea: in order to survive you, I must first survive myself)
* Reaching out to others to give positive reinforcement.
* Being a supportive son and brother to my family. Being a supportive person to my friends.
