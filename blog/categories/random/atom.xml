    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During high school and college I was a morning person. I loved getting up early in the mornings to read, play some video games, or any other topic that kept me in the &lsquo;flow&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m a night owl. I focus the best around 8pm. I don&rsquo;t know why, my brain just decides to turn on. I&rsquo;ll get about an hour and a half of pure focus, then it&rsquo;s time to wind down around 9:30 PM.</p>

<p>I prefer to be an early bird. As much as I try to force it, it&rsquo;s just not the same level of focus as I get at night. As much as I want to change, I must accept that I&rsquo;m a night owl now.</p>

<p>Although I cannot change or understand the why, all that matters now is that I&rsquo;m aware of this change. Something happened. Accept it. That&rsquo;s the important part.</p>
