In today's current society, the internet has enabled an entire species to read and listen on a global scale. Reading and listening is the de facto mechanism in which to share human knowledge to many generations past. There are endless amounts of digital content one can get through the medium of the internet.

(NOTE: I'm going to bucket the 'watch' category into listen and/or read. People read tons of online junk anyway!)

We know it in old caves as wall scrapings and paintings. There is the knowledge those cavemen passed along to their tribe. The unfortunate thing about that was that only those who veered onto the wall could read the message. The other issue would be - whose cave was this, anyway?! They might actually be wrong or have a different method of thinking than we did.

The internet, in some sense, eased this burden by providing an infinite level of walls that tribes could erect mass cave paintings in the endless amount of caves.

However, the internet has also enabled another mystery to the human mind: the paradox of choice. How does one today pick what to absorb next? in the millions of physical books, digitial e-books (and scanned copies of ancients), audio books, journals, online journals, blogs, and the bucket category of 'web pages' out in the world?

Capturing the knowledge itself once found is a near impossible task, I'm not going to even touch on that topic because it's thoroughly argued over enough on Hacker news. I'm going to attempt to share how I got to my filter to make reading an absolute enjoyable part of my life.

What isn't clear to me as of late is 'why' I read what I read. I'm attempting to write this post to enlighten myself and others about this filter that occurs when I move on to my next book.

I love reading, it's my absolute joy in the world. I try to capture the book list in my [knowledge](/knowledge) page.

The 2019 results are mostly in (although, at the time of writing this, there are a few more days left in the year to finish a few more books). What is clear though, that most of my reading is in the form of Audible. That is the main source of my content at this time. I have just recently got another Kindle Paperwhite, which I've replaced with my phone on my bedside stand. This little action has triggered the old habit of reading.

# My Caves

The caves I read from now come from a variety of sources:

* Email newsletters
* Audible content
* Kindle / E-books
* Physical Books

Let's dive into how I select each of these.

## My filtering pattern

For the 2019 year, I wanted to aim for reading two books a month aimed at two topics: personal growth and professional acumen growth. Sometimes, the books would be both. Other times, it would be totally random. It just so happens that what I read for joy is also in lined with what I love: psychology - how the human mind works.

I often joke that if I didn't go the computer science route, I would have gone to neuroscience or psychology. I'm a hobbyist at best in reading and studying psychology and the human mind. 

Certainly hitting the ripe age of 35 has triggered me to think more about philosophy, the meaning of the world, the strive to hold off suffering, and the ability to see the world anew.

I've driven into professional development - being a manager for the last year or so has given me a 'eyes wide open' view to the world of management. Most of my reading has been more than management though - it's more on leadership. [LINK TO BLOG POST TALKING ABOUT WHY MANAGERS ARE GOOD LEADERS - QBQ BLOG POST]
