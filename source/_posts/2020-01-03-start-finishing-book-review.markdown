I'm currently diving into a book recommended by Seth Godin - Start Finishing. This book is primarily aimed at supplying people with additional approachs to tackling 'important problems'.

# No ideas, only projects

Throughout the book, the author Charlie Gilkey describes that there are no ideas that we work on, we work on projects. The important part here being, deciding what we need to do to complete these projects. By figuring out what we say no to, we can say yes to the right things. This book starts by breaking down some systems one can take to figure out what the right things are, they 'burying' the rest.

# Shared mental models

Charlie gives some symbological meanings to completing by giving some simple mental models. It's not really the ideas here that are original, but rather the ideas with their corresponding mental models that make this book shine.

## Head Trash

For example, I catch myself sabotoging my own projects, ideas, or thoughts. The mental model i've had before has been 'what I say when I talk to myself', Charlie calls this 'head trash'. The symbology there is powerful - trash being something that is stinky and we don't need to keep around but we keep around in our heads.

Charlie then attacks the more important questions that revolve around momento mori - that you have only so many 'best work' ideas left in your life. This number is found by taking 85, subtracting your age, and dividing by 5 and rounding down. This time for projects

## Creative constipation

Another great mental model is one of 'creative constipation'. In that, when we have a fun creative idea, we may not act on it. And all humans have experience with constipation, it's very uncomfortable. Charlie addresses this again by stating, by finishing one, we can move on to the next. However, if we start, and perhaps do not finish, it will build up to those uncomfortable levels.

## Success Pack

This is the idea that with it takes a village to raise a kid. Like the kid, the project too needs champions that can help keep you on the path to success.

## Gates


## Work blocks

# Chapter 7 (DONE)

## Myths

We tell ourselves myths about success, like it will wreck or prevent a relationship, the success vs virtue myth, and the 'what if i cant do it again' myth. These are all false. Many can go on to create success without any bad effects, as long as one plans the blocks appropriately.

## Mediocracy

We often choose mediocrity in the short term, because we don't want to succeed due to the no-win myths above. But we also don't want to fail - mediocrity is the space between success and failure.

## Success pack

Gather a group of people who will support you along your best work projects. Turn to them when you need help, guidance. These can be mentors, but not necessarily there with you. They can be like in the book "Think and Grow Rich", where you could ask yourself what that person would do, even when they are not physically there or available for a call.

## OPP

OPP = other peoples priorities. This can take you away from your best work. Learn how to get away from them. The longer your best work project goes on, the more OPP you'll have to contend with it. Plan ahead that you need to respond to them. If you aren't clear about your priorities, you'll continually be beset with OPP.

Look for opportunities that you can include OPP into your own work, somehow.

## Derailers and Naysayers

There will always exist some that will take you off your project and into doubt. Derailers might now know that they are derailing you. Tell them or get curious to see why they do that.

Naysayers are just that, haters are going to hate. Avoid them. Or instead, turn to your success pack.

Charlie says:

> Every ounce of energy you use grappling with a naysayer is much better spent on working on your project and interacting with your success pack

## Project post-mortems

Take some time during a project to do a post-mortem. This isn't to say the project will die, but look for opportunities to improve. Of course, you can also benefit by attempting to think through these things from the start, of course. Attempt to do as much learning as you can.




# Part 3 - Working the Plan

# Chapter 8 - weave your project into your schedule

## Basic rules

The weekly block schedule, the Five projects rule, and your project road map together create a plan that you can follow and space to do the work.

Momentum planning is Charlie's term for the continual process of making and adjusting plans across all time perspectives. This means, doing weekly reviews, morning planning, and triaging. This also means weaving in the time blocking, project pyramid, and the Five Projects rule.

## Make sure your environment is working for you

The environment can define the working conditions. Charlie gives an example of how during his graduate school time, most of his best writing happened in 6 years over about 60 days. This was because he tackled writing at the library.

The environment you work in is very important - providing for your focus, momentum, and creativity.

## Stacking and Batching

Charlie makes the good point that it takes 16 minutes to refocus after being pulled from focus. There are some tricks he suggested, calling them stacking and batching.

Stacking = doing multiple things at once, when concentration is not required. The example here, while doing laundry, listen to an audiobook. While it seems like it's multitasking, it's not. Due to the less needs of the cognitive side of the brain, this becomes easy to do, riding the muscle memory train. Other examples: doing a meeting over a hike, exercising in the park while with the kids.

The second is batching - the example being that you set up admin blocks (described before) to check email, do your paperwork, etc. Batch them up together to tackle in one go around.

## Reducing the dread-to-work ratio

Referencing the famous Mark Twain comment of eating a frog in the morning. Do it as early as possible, so that the rest of the day does not sap your creative and cognitive functions, while also decreasing the dread-to-work ratio of your day.

Dread is a function of time, meaning that if a chunk of work takes 5 minutes, it still takes 5 minutes. However, the 'dread' increases substantially with time. The longer it sits there, the more dread you've invested into the task. It's the psychological size that haunts you more than the task at hand.

Charlie states that the time you dread the task itself, the distinction becomes blurred, to the point that the time you spend worrying or thinking about it could have spent doing other things. If possible, batch the frogs together.

However, not all frogs can be done early in the morning, as they may require focus blocks. There will always be frogs, it's best to address them for what they are and set up some time to get them done.

## 5 / 10 / 15 split

This little time split reminds you to keep 5 projects at max, with 10 minutes for momentum planning before you start your day, and 15 minutes at the end of your day. This keeps you focused on the daily level.

Try to not plan too far out ahead, the example being you do not plan every gas break, stop light, and every other part of your travel if you are taking a car trip.

# Chapter 9 - Build Daily Momentum



# Unorganized notes

## Ch 1 - "Someday" can be today
## Ch 2 - Getting to your best work
## Ch 3 - Pick an idea that works
## Ch 4 - Convert your idea into a project

SMART goals. Remember and use it.

## Ch 5 - Make space for your project

Finding the goal of this chapter is that it's a marathon, not a sprint. Plan the sprints to be only three focus blocks per week to maintain momentum, efficiency, and focus.

Think of the chunks of work over time as blocks. You can have so many blocks per week.

Five projects rule??

The project pyramid. Made of Yearly Goal at the top, quarters, months, then weeks.

There are blocks of time to schedule, based on some categories:

* Focus Blocks
* Social Blocks
* Admin Blocks
* Recovery Blocks


## Ch 6 - Build your project road map

### Finding your true flow - Gates

Focus on your strengths, use them to your advantage. Use this gage to find your strengths:

* Genius - what seems to be an expression of an inner creative force
* Affinities - what you're drawn to
* Talents - what seems to be your native skills or capabilities
* Expertise - What you've learned through experience and practice
* Strengths - What seems to come easy for you

Charlie here calls our Jonathan Fields and his Sparketypes that can help guide along your strengths. Charlie also calls for a budget that you can use to support yourself along your best work projects. By spending some money on yourself, within budget, you can buy more time to work on your best work projects. The example he gives here is brilliant - paying for grocery delivery service if it takes time away from your project during your highly creative times.
