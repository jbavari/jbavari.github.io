During high school and college I was a morning person. I loved getting up early in the mornings to read, play some video games, or any other topic that kept me in the 'flow'.

Now I'm a night owl. I focus the best around 8pm. I don't know why, my brain just decides to turn on. I'll get about an hour and a half of pure focus, then it's time to wind down around 9:30 PM.

I prefer to be an early bird. As much as I try to force it, it's just not the same level of focus as I get at night. As much as I want to change, I must accept that I'm a night owl now.

Although I cannot change or understand the why, all that matters now is that I'm aware of this change. Something happened. Accept it. That's the important part.
